# PART 1: More on narrative data viz

* **What's the point of Figure 7?**

Figure 7 shows a table that represents the design space. The table was created analyzing 58 visualizations where the 71% were taken from online journalism, the 20% from business and the 9% from visalization research.

These examples demonstrate the best practices for working with data visualization based on the medium we are using. We can see several design components and certain trends in the data.

* **Use Figure 7 to find the most common design choice within each category for the Visual narrative and Narrative structure (the categories within visual narrative are 'visual structuring', 'highlighting', etc).**

Three distinct strategies are used in the **Visual Narrative**: 
* Visual Structuring, where the most common design option is Consistent Visual Platform. 

* Highlighting, where the most popular design is Feature Disctinction.

* Transitional Guidance, where Object Continuty is the most popular design.

On the other hand, **Narrative Structure** presents us with three distinct portions as well.

* Ordering, where the Utilized directed path design is the most common.

* Interactivity, with the most popular design being Filtering, Selection, and Search.

* Messaging, where headlines and captions are the most frequent design.

* **Check out Figure 8 and section 4.3. What is your favorite genre of narrative visualization? Why? What is your least favorite genre? Why?**

Our favourite genre is the Film/Video or Animation since is the one that offers the highest level of engagement and storytelling immersion because it incorporates not only visuals and animations but also audio.

The Magazine style is the one we like the least. When it comes to narrative visualization, it only permits a small number of visualizations, which restricts the storytelling. We believe that for some people, reading so much can be a burden.
